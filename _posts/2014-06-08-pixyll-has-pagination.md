FTWD rancho edition

Friends come over to los Cedros house
We're going on a trip or I'm packing to go on a separate trip from everyone else
Or maybe we rented the house in Airbnb and stayed there for a while and then we were all on separate flights home to where we live now
I have a really early flight and have to pack and I'm worried there's not enough time to pack and make it to ONT
I try to call an uber but there aren't any and I'm getting more anxious that I'm going to miss that flight
I contemplate options but Instead of racing to the airport and having friends send luggage separately, I decide to pack and try uber again
It's like really dim outside like lots of ash in the sky or something so not really cloudy but def not full sun
SJ and Mom are there
We're standing on the lawn outside (which is green not dead) and we notice that a bunch of people are jumping into users
I wonder why I'm having such trouble
I jump on the uber app and put in destination as airport and keep hitting find driver but folks keep cancelling
So I go outside and waive down an uber acting like its mine when it's not
Car is packed like 10 people in an escalade
I ask if there's room cuz I'm going to miss my flight. They rudely say no and go off

I look over to the left and our old crazy neighbor is fucking with our side lawn like going back into the backyard
Mom looks worried and I tell her I'll tell them to stop that they can't do that
I go up to side beneath the big cypress trees and at the same time they're walking back from the yard with these big white feathers
I yell at them "this is our property what the hell are you doing stop that or I'll call the cops"
They begin to argue that it's their property
Uh you're dumb the backyards are literally fenced our property is this side yours is that side
Fuck you don't ever do that again get off our property
They concede and walk away next door to their property

I turn around and notice that now the entrance to the street is blocked off by one of those crowd control fence
The gates not high
There is a crowd of maybe thirty or forty people on the neighborhoods side of the fence, and a couple people on the other side in the middle of the seat
I notice SJ is in the crowd and walk over to her
"What's going on"
"There's zombies or something and we're taking turns killing them. But they're not like lethargic they're really fast"
Wtf

I stand in the crowd and make my way up to the front where SJ, mom, and friends are
Im watching how a woman on the other side of the fence is passing around a box of business cards. SJ explains how they're passing out random numbers that are written on the cards as a waiting list for who gets to kill the zombies
Wtf
There's maybe four men outside the fence in the middle of the street. Looks like they're there to make sure everything is ok and the zombie gets killed
Maybe one guy at opposite end from main arterial road Victoria (can't remember actual name but it's like the streets los Cedros and pecan etc then the major street the middle school is on). There's two or four guys in the middle of the street directly in front of fence and then like one guy more towards the middle school
Someone announces that they're coming and everyone gets excited wtf they call out the number of who is going next and they go around the fence and assume what I guess is a fighting position in the street

SJ explains again how the zombies are actually really tough and aggressive and kinda smart but above all super fast. The neighborhood is protecting itself by killing the zombies in the street to make sure they don't get to the houses

I look out over the fence toward the middle school and see what I can only assume is a big bad from a power rangers episode sprinting towards us. It's a human but not really its kinda gray or almost stone ish and has a nasty almost happy snarl on its face
Holy shit it's probably moving 30 mph

Then all of a sudden a big rock or maybe some other projectile hits it in the head and the zombies momentum causes it's legs to fly toward while the head/torso falls toward the ground
One of the neighbors whose turn it was did that
Everyone starts cheering
What the actual fuck

Seems like the zombie died. Everyone is positive upbeat that we as a community are awesome and are gonna be fine

SJ mentions how she's gonna be up soon so I guess it's not a random draw but more like a waiting list. We chat a little but and I for whatever reason begin to feel ok about the situation. I take a business card for myself

Oh and there's like old ladies tryin to get in on this. Uhm ok whatever were all in good spirits we rock etc etc

30 min pass. I look out toward the middle schools street and realize that there are a few zombies racing down the street perpendicular to us. Like sprinting down the street. Then I can see more and I realize the number of zombies i can see is slowly increasing. Not really increasing but the frequency of zombies that speed past our Main Street on the larger middle school street is increasing. One of the sprinters hits the stop sign by accident and looks toward our group and begins to sprint again but this time toward us. Frequency of sprinter zombies keeps increasing, zombies running side by side now like a marathon. Fuck you. Some are moving so fast it's just a blur and I can't make out what they look like

The new zombie comes up and gets killed by someone and it's pretty much the same as last time. They move the body away to the side onto someone's lawn
Like what the duck were not the only street of houses in the entire housing track where is everyone else. My neighbors are happy and cheering

The marathon of zombies gets denser and this time three or four notice us and begin racing toward us. Again marathon is the wrong word but I don't know what a dense pack of lots of sprinters is called. It's fucking scary how many there are but maybe I'm crazy cuz everyone else is fine

The people who are organizing and passing out the business cards call out for more people to smash kill the zombies again. They jump over the fence and get into what I can only guess is what they think a fighting formation pattern should be. Mind you these are mostly old people from Rancho Cucamonga 

SJ still not called thank god. We have a little group and were at front of the crowd, fence is between us and the fighters. The fence is only in the street and doesn't even span the full width of the street. And with the sidewalks, were actually pretty much unprotected

First zombie comes up and slams into the guy who wasn't ready. Another one is racing up but he's obscured by something. It's a piece of concrete, covering his entire body and is low to the ground so I can't see his legs imagine a floating piece of concrete coming toward you. A piece of concrete that is actually a piece of some fucking street. A huge piece that looks like it's a half ton. 

The zombie fucking throws the piece of concrete at us in my general direction. It hits the ground in front of me (I back up) but definitely inside our "safe zone" created by the crowd control fence

What the fuck. I think everyone begins to realize at this point that this is not going to end well.

I dodge the huge slab of concrete and realize it puts me 20 feet from this shorty zombie. It kinda looks like a ninja turtle. Lit is a mutant. Maybe 4 ft tall, stubby arms, super fucking scary and gray colored. And i can tell by the look on its face that it's plotting it's next move

Note these zombies are not vocal/ mostly silent

Everyone is standing around staring at it. The irony of the situation is not lost on me. Folks were literally clapping and fiending for their turn maybe 30 minutes ago and now here's a zombie right in front of them that needs to be killed asap but everyone is just standing around.

I fuck the fuck out of that situation and walk/jog back to the house. I notice mom is almost back to the house too. We talk she's mostly not scared.

On our lawn I Notice that EB is there and has bleached blond short hair and I'm pissed because I also have bleached blond hair but it's longer. It reminds me that i gotta cut my hair soon and that its so played out so maybe cut off bleached part

I go into the house run down the hall to my room close the door and flip the light, wait I gotta hide so I turn off the light, and jump in bed
